#REQUIREMENTS

You need SDL libraries to run (or recompile) this game.

#GAME

Just double-click on rungame.sh script and select the binary version.

#INFO

The sound-fix version has changed default sound output format. It is quieter, but at least works. I have no idea
if this is problem with the game itself or SDL library problem or just problem with BeOS SDL port.
Please see included beos-sndfix.patch to get the idea about the difference.
The original, unpatched game source code is in REminiscence-0.1.9/ directory.
